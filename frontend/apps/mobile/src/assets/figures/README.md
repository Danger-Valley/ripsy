# `fig1.riv` runtime contract

The file contains one `Artboard` with two state machines:

- `State Machine Back` — local pieces facing away from the player.
- `State Machine Front` — opponent pieces facing the player.

## Timeline animations

`Flagstoke`, `No Weapon`, `Scissors`, `Stone`, `Paper`, `Clipping`, `Idle Back Weapon Revealed`, `Idle Back`, `Idle`, `Jump Forward`, `Jump Right`, `Jump Left`, `Attack Prepare Back`, `Attack Prepare`, `Attack Scissors Front`, `Attack Scissors Back`, `Attack Paper Back`, `Attack Paper Front`, `Attack Stone Back`, `Attack Stone Front`, `Trap Front`, `Trap Back`, `Trap Back Idle`, `Fall In Trap Back`, `Fall In Trap Front`, and `Death`.

## State machine inputs

Both machines expose the numeric `Weapon` input and these triggers: `Jump Forward`, `Jump Right`, `Jump Left`, `Attack Prepare`, `Attack`, `Trap Activate`, `Fall In Trap`, and `Death`.

`State Machine Back` additionally exposes numeric `WeaponVisible` and the `Trap Idle` trigger. `WeaponVisible` is a number (`0` or `1`), not a boolean.

Mobile movement fires the appropriate jump trigger on the moving Rive instance. Horizontal direction is calculated after converting server coordinates to player-visible board coordinates; vertical movement uses `Jump Forward` because the asset has no backward jump.
